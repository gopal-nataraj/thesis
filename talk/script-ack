First,
I thank my co-advisors Jeff and Jon.
Jeff realized that I might like research
before I even realized I might like research
all the way back in 2010
during an undergraduate UM visitation day,
when I was a sophomore at Cornell.
Jeff has since then helped me develop
my intuition and yet also rigor,
my persistence and yet also humility.
I hope to be half as productive as he is one day.
Asking Jon to be my co-advisor in 2014,
also per Jeff's recommendation by the way,
was perhaps the best decision I made during grad school.
Since our very first scan together,
Jon has treated me as a professional researcher
which was key to building my research confidence
in those early days.
Most practical things that I know about MRI today
are due to him.

Next,
I thank my thesis committee.
Clay was a key contributor and coauthor on the PERK paper.
Doug's medical imaging systems lectures are so good
that I visited his class two years ago,
even though I had already taken the class.
He has since then also contributed several times
in helping me get perhaps esoteric algorithms
working on real MR data with real MR nonidealities,
and understanding why things break when they do.
Scott was actually the first person who let me touch
an MR scanner back in 2013
during a medical imaging lab.
He has since then had several discussions with me
about myelin imaging.

Next,
I thank my collaborators at UM.
Mingjie adapted PERK to work on MR fingerprinting data
and ran the fast-fraction scan optimizations.
Steven has been 
and I hope plans to continue working
on off-resonance-sensitive myelin imaging.

Next,
I thank the funding that made this work possible.
In particular,
the University of Michigan funded a large portion
of this proof-of-concept work
and deserves recognition 
for supporting exploratory research.

Next,
I thank my many friends and colleagues here at UM,
old and new.
You have made what is ultimately a solitary journey
much more fun and fulfilling.
I am aware that I didn't work too often 
in the LOJ, or lab of Jeff,
but that's only because I often found myself
socializing too much and working too little while there.

Next,
I thank my roommates, Adam and Trey.
All three of us moved here together 
from Cornell back in 2012.
None of us had much facial hair back then.
Adam in particular has lived with me 
in the same apartment
for the entire duration of our PhDs.
He has been with me
through every single one of the highs and lows.

Next,
I thank my family.
I don't think too many people can say 
that three generations of family 
attended their PhD defense.
I am humbled and am grateful 
for their unconditional love and support.

And finally,
I thank Manisha.
Simply put,
she is the light of my life.
If you enjoyed the upma,
you have her to thank.
If you didn't enjoy it, 
we'll say that I made it.
Manisha, I can't wait to get married
and start the next chapter of our lives together.

I hope that covers everyone here today,
but just in case I'll say again
thank you the audience 
for attending my defense,
and I'd be happy to take questions.
