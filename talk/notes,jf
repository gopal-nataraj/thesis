notes during defense talk
taken by jeff fessler

s9: perhaps preview the two scan design methods in thesis intro?
(min-max, bayes)

dh: how bad is the worst case?
todo: comment on that in ch. 4

todo: where is supplement of ch. 4?
specifically, exploration of multicompartment effects?

s22 importance sampling for efficiency?

s25: jf: why 2,1 instead of 0,2

jf: train not scaling with # of slices - kappas?

cs: s27 train/test

dh: use perk to start GD?

"cutely named" - takes one to know one, mr. perk !

34 "implies neglecting exchange"

ss: T2 assumed?
dn: short TE to neglect exchange - longitudinal exchange?  T1?

40: show flip-angle map in ch6 for both simulation and in vivo data

dad: path to commercialization?
todo: spell it out in thesis (last chapter)
ex vivo, patients

dh: why descending ML makes it worse?
go: why KRR not NN?

jn: exchange - how to convince others

"can't design without gradients?"

ss: GRASE - how much acceleration?
todo: mention it

ss: laplace transforms / T2 histograms
todo: show one (from ROI?)

ss: workflow in clinic?

ss: myelin in muscle ?
dn: other two compartment models

jn: vessels / flow effects

ss: compare to mcDESPOT?

cs: importance of prior?

jn: training based on noise measurement - sensitivity
todo: mention possibility of

dn: what parameters do you need, just B1+?
todo: revisit scan design

lots of future work items to list!
