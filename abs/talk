Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (QMRI)
produces images of MR biomarkers,
or measurable tissue properties
that are indicative 
of physiological processes
that characterize the onset and progression
of specific disorders.
(For example,
MR elasticity imaging is indicative 
of the abnormal tissue hardening
that characterizes sclerosis.)
QMRI has potential 
to be more informative
than conventional qualitative MRI
but poses challenges beyond those of conventional MRI
that currently limit its feasibility 
for routine clinical use.

This thesis develops tools 
to address two key QMRI challenges
and applies these tools
to develop a new method 
for myelin water imaging,
a challenging application
that may be indicative 
of certain demyelinating conditions
such as multiple sclerosis.
To address long QMRI scan times,
this thesis first develops a method
to assemble fast, statistically informative acquisitions
that enable min-max optimally precise biomarker estimation.
To address the challenges of estimating biomarkers
from highly nonlinear and possibly unavailable MR signal models,
this thesis next develops a method
to "learn" a very efficient biomarker estimator
purely from simulated training data.
The tools developed in this thesis enable
whole-brain high-resolution in vivo myelin water imaging
in about 10 minutes of scan time,
whereas state-of-the-art methods
require 30 minutes or more.
