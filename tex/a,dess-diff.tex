% diffusive signal loss in dess

In the completed thesis,
this appendix will present
an unpublished analysis
of model mismatch 
in single-compartment DESS signal models 
\eqref{eq:dess-def-model} and \eqref{eq:dess-ref-model}
in the presence of diffusion.
We first develop models
that describe the single-compartment DESS signal 
in the presence of diffusion.
We then use these models
to show through phantom experiments
that neglecting diffusive effects
during $\Tt$ estimation
(as in Chapters~\ref{c,relax}-\ref{c,scn-dsgn})
induces significant estimation bias.
We conclude with recommendations
for MR acquisition settings
(specifically, for dephasing gradient area)
that reduce diffusion-related estimation bias
without excessively imparting other bias.
These recommendations were used 
to guide DESS acquisition design
for all relevant experiments
considered in the main body of this thesis.
