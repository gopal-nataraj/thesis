% myelin water fraction estimation from steady state sequences

\section{Introduction}
\label{s,mwf,intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Myelin is a lipid-rich material
that forms an insulating sheath
encasing neuronal axons 
predominantly in white matter (WM) regions
of the human brain
\cite{morell:84}.
Demyelination (\ie, myelin loss) is central
to the development 
of several neurodegenerative disorders
such as multiple sclerosis (MS)
\cite{goldenberg:12:msr}. 
Non-invasive myelin quantification in WM
is thus desirable 
for monitoring the onset and progression
of neurodegenerative disease.

% MR relaxation rates (esp t2) depend on water environment
% local water environment changes on sub-millimeter scale
% MR sensitive only on millimeter scale
% need to assign a macroscopic t2 to each pool or compartment
% thus multiple water compartments contribute to each voxel at typical resolutions
MR relaxation time constants
(especially spin-spin time constant $\Tt$)
depend on the macromolecular environment
surrounding excited water molecules.
In nervous tissue,
these environments vary spatially
on scales much smaller 
than the millimeter-scale resolutions
used in typical MR imaging experiments.
Thus, 
there is significant variation
of relaxation times 
within a typical imaging voxel 
containing nervous tissue.

% natural to try to separate t2 components in mri
% several groups measured first in vitro short t2 pool in white matter
% assigned to water in myelin (trapped in bilayers?)
% later measured in vivo, who termed mwf (mackay)
% mwf found to correlate well in vivo with histology (laule)
% mwf thus noninvasive MR-based biomarker for myelin content
Many researchers have attempted 
to characterize tissue microstructure
by estimating the distribution
of MR relaxation time constants
and associating certain ranges of time constants
with particular ``compartments'' or ``pools'' of water molecules
that exist in similar macromolecular environments.
Several \invitro NMR studies
of nervous animal tissue
prescribed a fast-relaxing water compartment
with $\Tt\sim$10-40ms 
initially to general protein 
and phospholipid structures \cite{vasilescu:78:wci}
and later more specifically
to water trapped between
the phospholipid bilayers 
of myelin
\cite{menon:91:aoc, stewart:93:ssr}.
Shortly thereafter,
the first MR images 
of so-called \emph{myelin water fraction} (MWF),
defined as the proportion of MR signal 
arising from the fast-relaxing water compartment
relative to total MR signal,
were demonstrated \emph{in vivo}
in the human brain \cite{mackay:94:ivv}.
More recently,
MWF has been shown 
to correlate well 
with histological measurements
of myelin content 
in animal models
of nerve injury \cite{gareau:00:mta}
and demyelination \cite{webb:03:imt}.
In humans, 
MWF has also been measured 
to be markedly lower
in ``normally appearing'' WM 
of MS patients versus controls \cite{laule:04:wca},
and to correlate strongly 
with post-mortem histological measurements
of myelin content
in MS patients \cite{laule:06:mwi}.
Thus,
there is reasonably strong evidence
that MWF
(as originally measured in \cite{mackay:94:ivv})
is a specific and non-invasive biomarker
for myelin content in WM.

% all aforementioned studies used MESE 
% MESE typically uses long tr to ensure full recovery between excitations
% thus MESE acquisitions take long time
% mcdespot based on ss techniques (specifically spgr and bssfp) 
% shown to disagree significantly with ss 
% maybe due to insufficient precision
All of the aforementioned studies
estimate MWF images
from a multi-echo spin echo (MESE) MRI acquisition.
To ensure sufficient $\To$ recovery,
these studies employ long $\TR\geq2$s
to ensure sufficient $\To$ recovery
of the longitudinal magnetization in WM.
Whole-brain MWF imaging 
using such long-$\TR$ MESE acquisitions
at a typical imaging resolution
would require hours of imaging time
and thus may not be clinically practical.



This chapter applies previously developed methods
for QMRI acquisition (Chapter~\ref{c,scn-dsgn})
and scalable QMRI parameter estimation (Chapter~\ref{c,krr})
for myelin water fraction imaging.
