% appendix: sense with multiple datasets

In the completed thesis,
this appendix will describe 
an unpublished algorithm
for combining multiple MRI datasets
when each dataset is acquired 
using multiple receiver coils
with fixed coil geometry.
Such sequences of coil datasets arise naturally
in many quantitative MRI applications,
including the ones studied
in Chapters~\ref{c,scn-dsgn}-\ref{c,krr}.
The algorithm extends \cite{ying:07:jir}
(which considers joint image reconstruction
and coil sensitivity estimation
in the case of a single dataset)
to exploit the fixed coil sensitivity 
across several datasets,
thereby improving estimation conditionality
as compared to separate coil combination
across datasets.
